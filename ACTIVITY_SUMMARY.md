  - Secure user registration with validation
  - Login with account lockout protection (5 failed attempts)
  - Password strength validation
  - Account status verification

### Step 3: ✅ Authorization Service  
- **Services/AuthorizationService.cs**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
  - 10+ granular permissions (CreateUser, ModifyUser, DeleteUser, etc.)
  - Role hierarchy (Admin > Moderator > User)
  - Permission inheritance and validation
  - Action-based authorization checks

### Step 4: ✅ Session Management
- **Services/SessionService.cs**: Secure session handling:
  - GUID-based session tokens
  - 24-hour session expiration
  - Automatic session cleanup
  - User context management
  - Session validation and renewal

### Step 5: ✅ Complete Integration
- **Program.cs**: Fully integrated application with:
  - All authentication endpoints (/register, /login, /logout)
  - Authorization endpoints (/user-management, /admin-panel)
  - Session endpoints (/profile, /current-user)
  - HTTPS configuration (production) with HTTP development support
  - Startup demo with sample users and permissions
  - Comprehensive error handling

### Step 6: ✅ Comprehensive Testing
- **72 authentication/authorization tests** covering:
  - User model validation and security
  - Authentication service functionality
  - Authorization and permission checks
  - Session management lifecycle
  - Integration testing with all endpoints
  - Security edge cases and attack prevention

### Activity 3: ✅ Security Debugging and Hardening

### Step 1: ✅ Vulnerability Identification and Demonstration
- **VulnerableDemo.cshtml/.cs**: Educational vulnerability demonstration page
  - Intentionally vulnerable form processing
  - XSS vulnerabilities through raw HTML output
